# wol-server
A lightweight wake on lan server powered by SSH!

## Steps to get started:
- run `apt install wakeonlan`
- place both bash files in the root directory of your server
- create new users with a mac address as the username, (without any colons or dashes - i.e. "./woluser aabbccddeeff")
- make sure the ssh port is open in the firewall
- provide the cmd script to your users with the desired mac address as the username
